## 📦 Deployment

Build the application for production:

npm run build
```

## Data Connections

This app can read real report data from **Firebase Firestore** and image URLs from **Supabase Storage**.

1. Create/obtain a Firebase project and a Cloud Firestore database with a top-level collection: `reports`.
   - Example document fields expected by the UI:
     - `title` (string)
     - `description` (string)
     - `category` (string, e.g. "Water / Drainage")
     - `city` (string)
     - `lat` (number), `lng` (number)
     - `status` (string: pending|in_progress|completed|rejected)
     - `photoURL` (string, ideally a public Supabase Storage file URL)
     - `createdAt` (ISO string), `updatedAt` (ISO string)

2. In `.env`, fill the `VITE_FIREBASE_*` values with your project credentials and set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` if you plan to use Supabase SDK.

3. Run locally:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

The home map pulls the latest 100 reports ordered by `createdAt`. The details page reads a single report by `id` from the URL.
